## Ozan's Image in Editor Plugin

Due to the fact that I always prefer seeing the images directly under the link when I write my notes in Markdown, I developed a plugin for myself to view images directly under the Editor view.

Users needs to use one of settings below to be able to view the images properly:

1. New Link Format -> **Relative path to file**

![Relative Path Settings](images/Relative_Path_Settings.png)
![Relative Path View](images/Relative_Path_View.png)

2. New Link Format -> **Absolute path in vault**

![Absolute Path Settings](images/Absolute_Path_Settings.png)
![Absolute Path View](images/Absolute_Path_View.png)

3. New Link Format -> **Shortest Path Possible** and Default location for new attachments -> **Vault Folder**

![Shortest Path Settings](/images/Shortest_Path_Settings.png)
![Shortest Path View](/images/Shortest_Path_Possible_View.png)

Relative and Absolute Path will give you possibility to add "alt" text for the image. You can decide about the size of the image using following 
alt texts:

1. #small
2. #x-small
3. #xx-small

If you have any issue or you have any suggestion, please feel free to reach me out directly using <me@ozan.pl>
