# Ozan's Image in Editor Plugin

## Brief Explanation

Because I always prefer seeing the images directly under the link when I paste or drag images into my Markdown notes, I developed a plugin for myself to view images directly under the Editor view.

## Requirement & Samples

- Users needs to use one of settings below to be able to view the images properly in the Editor view. It will ensure that plugin is able to generate the image source link correctly:

### 1 - First Option (Specified Folder)

*Files & Links --> Attachment Folder --> In the folder specified below*

<img src="images/Specified_Folder.png" width="80%"/>

You can set the attachment folder using the right click under tree view:

<img src="images/Attachment_Folder_Set.png" width="40%"/>

### 2 - Second Option (Vault Folder)

*Files & Links --> Attachment Folder --> Vault*

<img src="images/Default_Location_Vault.png" width="80%"/>

## Sample Views

- *Markdown Format*

<img src="images/Absolute_Path_View.png" width="70%"/>

<img src="images/Relative_Path_View.png" width="70%"/>

- *Wikilinks format*

<img src="images/Shortest_Path_Possible_View.png" width="70%"/>

## Image View Size

Relative and Absolute Path will give you possibility to add "alt" text for the image. You can decide about the size of the image using following 
alt texts:

1. #small
2. #x-small
3. #xx-small
